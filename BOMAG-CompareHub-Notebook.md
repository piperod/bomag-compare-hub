# BOMAG Compare Hub – Project Notebook

## Overview
This notebook documents the major features, improvements, and fixes implemented in the BOMAG Compare Hub project for future reference.

---

## 1. Multilanguage Support
- Implemented a `LanguageContext` with translations for Spanish, English, German, and Portuguese.
- All UI labels, machine data fields, and descriptions are translatable.
- Added a language toggle in the navbar for instant language switching.

## 2. Machine Data Integration
- Integrated detailed data for SDR, LTR, and HTR machines in `src/data/machineData.ts`.
- Machine data includes multilanguage fields, TCO timelines, and all relevant specs.
- Added/updated missing machines and corrected data as needed.

## 3. Comparison Views
### Detail Comparison
- `MachineComparison.tsx` provides a tabbed, interactive comparison table for selected machines.
- Tabs for Basic, Performance, Costs, and TCO Timeline (if available).
- Color-coded price comparison using a green-yellow-red interpolation.
- Machine images shown with robust fuzzy matching and environment-aware paths.

### Summary View
- `Summary.tsx` implements a global summary page with a transposed table (machines as columns, properties as rows).
- Interactive toggling of visible machines (columns) and properties (rows) with '×' icons.
- Tabs for SDR, LTR, and (optionally) HTR lines.
- Consistent styling and image handling as in the detail view.
- Added a TCO timeline table at the bottom, with color-coded price cells and TCO values.

## 4. UI/UX Improvements
- Navbar text set to black for better branding.
- Language toggle dropdown added to the navbar.
- Improved error handling for missing context providers.
- Replaced checkboxes with '×' icons for removing columns/rows in the summary view.
- Ensured responsive, modern UI with Tailwind CSS and custom color palette.

## 5. Deployment
- Configured for GitHub Pages deployment with correct base path and SPA fallback (`404.html`).
- Used `gh-pages` for automated deployment.
- Image paths and routing are compatible with both local and deployed environments.

## 6. Error Fixes & Troubleshooting
- Fixed context errors by wrapping all pages in `LanguageProvider`.
- Fixed image loading issues with robust path logic.
- Fixed LTR summary tab error by filtering visible machine indices.
- Identified and ignored unrelated browser extension IO errors.

## 7. Workflow
- All changes tracked in git, with regular commits and pushes.
- Deployment triggered after each major update.
- User feedback incorporated iteratively for rapid improvements.

## Next Steps / To-Do (if any)
- [ ] Add more machine lines or data as needed
- [ ] Further improve accessibility and error boundaries
- [ ] Add analytics or usage tracking if required
